# Fundamental Analysis Techniques

Welcome to the Fundamental Analysis Techniques Experimentation and Mini Dashboard Repository!

This repository contains code and documentation for experimenting with different fundamental analysis techniques and implementing them in a mini dashboard.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource for those interested in learning and experimenting with fundamental analysis techniques in the context of financial markets.

In this repository, you will find various implementations of fundamental analysis techniques such as:

- Financial statement analysis
- Ratio analysis
- Discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis
- Dividend discount model (DDM) analysis
- Economic analysis
- Industry analysis

These implementations are designed to be easy to understand and modify, so that you can experiment with different inputs and assumptions to see how they affect the results.

The repository also includes a mini dashboard that displays the results of the fundamental analysis techniques implemented in the code. This dashboard is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, so that you can quickly and easily see the results of your analysis.

To use this repository, simply clone the repository and explore the code and documentation. You can modify the code to experiment with different inputs and assumptions, and use the dashboard to visualize the results.

I hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for those interested in learning and experimenting with fundamental analysis techniques. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
